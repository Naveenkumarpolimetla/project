The Food Waste Management project is a platform designed to connect individuals, organizations, and businesses with excess food to people in need. The primary goal of the website is to reduce food waste by providing a way to book and donate surplus food to prevent it from being discarded. This website is designed to make food donation easy and accessible, fostering a sustainable and community-driven solution to food insecurity and waste.
